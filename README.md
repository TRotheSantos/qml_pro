Using the same Quantum Embedding Structure as in paper page 10:   Thomas Hubregtsen, David Wierichs, Elies Gil-Fuster, Peter-Jan H. S. Derks, Paul K. Faehrmann, and Johannes Jakob Meyer. “Training Quantum Embedding Kernels on Near-Term Quantum Computers.” arXiv:2105.02276, 2021. 

Scalable Model: Number of Qubits (Wires) and Number of Consecutive Layers can be chosen by user of the model


Loss Function is based on maximizing the Kernel-Target-Alignment, a Formula to evaluate how well a given Kernel including his Variationa Parameters captures the characteristics of the dataset
